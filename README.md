## Features

- Merges multiple PDF files into a single output PDF.
- Handles PDFs with different page counts seamlessly.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Reading**:
   - Each input PDF is opened and read using `PyPDF2`.
2. **Page Merging**:
   - All pages from the input PDFs are added to a `PdfWriter` instance, which consolidates them.
3. **PDF Writing**:
   - The merged content is written to a new output PDF file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the following package:

   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2
